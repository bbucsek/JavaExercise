# JavaExercise

This is a simple Java exercise project. 

In this project I try to recreate Data structures, Design patterns and Algorithms for practice.

Implemented:

Data Structures:
  - Array List
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Hashmap
  - Linked List
  - Queue
  - Stack

Design Patterns:
  - Builder Pattern
  
Sorting Algorithms:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
